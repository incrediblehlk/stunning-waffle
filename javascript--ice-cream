/*
 * Programming Quiz: Ice Cream (3-6)
 *
 * Write a single if statement that logs out the message:
 * 
 * "I'd like two scoops of __________ ice cream in a __________ with __________."
 * 
 * ...only if:
 *   - flavor is "vanilla" or "chocolate"
 *   - vessel is "cone" or "bowl"
 *   - toppings is "sprinkles" or "peanuts"
 *
 * We're only testing the if statement and your boolean operators. 
 * It's okay if the output string doesn't match exactly.

// the or operator ( || ) doesn't work here - because if it is one but not the other it falsely triggers still, hence "&&"
// combining to something like flavor != "vanilla" && "chocolate" also didn't work

else if (flavor != "vanilla" && flavor != "chocolate") {

// ---------------

// NOTES


// this appeared to work at first, until all variables were acceptable variables, then it triggered the error that they shouldn't see.
// if (flavor === ("vanilla" || "chocolate") && vessel === ("cone" || "bowl") && toppings === ("sprinkles" || "peanuts")) {
    console.log("I'd like two scoops of " + flavor + " ice cream in a " + vessel + " with " + toppings + ".")
}

// ------

// WHY DOES THE BELOW CODE ALLOW THE INCORRECT TOPPINGS TO PRINT TO THE CONSOLE? BUT PARENTHESES FIX IT?
