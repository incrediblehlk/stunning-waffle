// set the value of this based on a person's education
var salary = 0;

// your code goes here

}
console.log("In 2015, a person with " + education + " earned an average of $" + salary.toLocaleString("en-US") + "/year.")

// NOTES

// the var salary = 0; is a placeholder for other things to build on. if this has quotes instead - var salary = ""; 
// then the .toLocaleString won't work because it sees this as a string
// the numbers also need to be numbers and not strings (no quotes)

// would be interesting to modify this to see the differences in salaries with each increase
