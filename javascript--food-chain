 * Programming Quiz - Navigating the Food Chain (3-8)
 *
 * Use a series of ternary operator to set the category to one of the following:
 *   - "herbivore" if an animal eats plants
 *   - "carnivore" if an animal eats animals
 *   - "omnivore" if an animal eats plants and animals
 *   - undefined if an animal doesn't eat plants or animals
 *
 * Notes
 *   - use the variables `eatsPlants` and `eatsAnimals` in your ternary expressions
 *   - `if` statements aren't allowed ;-)
 */

// change the values of `eatsPlants` and `eatsAnimals` to test your code
var eatsPlants = false;
var eatsAnimals = false;

var category = eatsPlants ? (eatsAnimals ? "omnivore" : "herbivore") : (eatsAnimals ? "carnivore" : undefined)

console.log(category);

// ----------
// NOTES
// ----------

// the ? and : are replacing if else statements and are called a ternary operator

// if the thing before the question is true = thing before the colon
// if false = thing after the colon

// this code nests an additional question to give more options
