    num > 2 ? (console.log (num + " bottles of juice on the wall! " + num + " bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... " + (num-1) + " bottles of juice on the wall!")) : (num === 2 ?

" + (num-1) + " bottle of juice on the wall!")) : (console.log (num + " bottle of juice on the wall! " + num + " bottle of juice! Take one down, pass it around... " + (num-1) + " bottles of juice on the wall!")))
    // decrement num
    num += -1;
}



// notes

// there are a few conditionals here and a loop, basically:


// while there is more than one bottle
// (more than 2 bottles) ? (print above 2 bottles) : (exactly 2 bottles ? (print 2 bottles) : (print 1 bottle))
// decrease bottle count by 1
